                        As a accelerated degree student at Drexel University graduating in the spring with a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science, 
                        Widchard Faustin has taken his university's slogan, "Ambition Can't Wait", and truly made it into his own. From studying Artificial
                        Intelligence, to Game Development, to Human Computer Interaction, he has learned many facets of the software developing world and 
                        become proficient in many programming languages and frameworks. Despite having a busy academic life, Widchard also manages to keep
                        active socially. On top of being a Dean's Ambassador for Drexel's College of Computing and Informatics, Widchard is also a member of 
                        Drexel's Percussion Ensemble, where he accompanies the rest of the group on piano.

                        Widchard has always had a passion for STEM. From a young age, he was going to summer camps learning how to program robots with Lego
                        Mindstorms Kits and building Rube Goldberg machines. As he got older, his love for solving problems like an engineer only grew, and
                        it eventually led him to picking up Computer Science as his major in order to solve problems in the cyberspace.

                        This website was made to display some of the many projects Widchard has worked on, and display his growth and proficiency throughout his
                        college career to both future employers and interest individuals. These projects range from small personal projects to term-long school 
                        group assignments, and all show a different aspect to Widchard's different skillset.
